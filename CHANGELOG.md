# Changelog

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-05 (in progress)

### Added
- **Unified lifecycle config** in `config.yml` under `after_step` and `after_task` sections covering review, tests, commit, and push. Review/tests take scope values (`partial | full | false | ask`); commit/push take boolean values (`true | false | ask`). `ask` fires upfront at `/run-step` or `/run-task` entry with a two-stage prompt: Stage 1 picks the action for this run (with timing-specific recommendations — `No` for step, `Full`/`Yes` for task, `No` for push), Stage 2 asks whether to save the answer as the new default in `config.yml`. `run-task` batches every `ask` entry into a single upfront prompt so the run proceeds unattended. The `reviewer` subagent now receives an explicit corpus (working-tree diff for uncommitted steps, last-commit diff for committed steps, branch diff for task close) — step-loop.md and run-task.md compute the corpus automatically based on commit state. Deprecated `commit.mode` / `commit.finish_action` / `after_task.deep_review` / `after_task.full_tests` keys are silently migrated on first read via `ensure-config.md`. `after_task.commit` is skipped automatically when any step committed during the run (detected via `git log --since="{task created}"`); `after_task.push` fires independently so step-level commits still reach the remote.
- **`.aicontext/config.yml`**: YAML config file replacing prose settings in `project.md` — commit rules, task naming, spec naming, update check frequency, Claude question style
- **`config.local.yml`**: gitignored personal config overrides
- **`ensure-config.md`**: reusable prompt for config loading — creates from template if missing, fills missing keys, migrates stale settings from `project.md`
- **`config.template.yml`**: ships with defaults during `aicontext init`
- **CLI interactive config setup**: `aicontext init` and `update` ask about task naming, commit mode, and update check frequency
- **`commit.co_authored_trailer`**: three modes — custom string (overrides AI tool default), `false` (no trailer), `default` (AI tool's built-in format)
- **`commit.finish_action: ask`**: interactive mode that asks what to do on each task completion
- **`claude.question_style`** config: `interactive` (AskUserQuestion) or `numbered` (plain text) for Claude Code users
- **Question UX rule** in `standards.md`: closed questions use clickable options in Claude Code, numbered options in other tools
- **"Solution Before Organization" rule** in `standards.md`: confirm approach before asking about task scope/spec assignment
- **"Checkbox Discipline" rule** in `process.md`: verify items fully match their description before checking off
- **`installConfig` and `setConfigValue`** CLI functions with 9 tests
- **Ideas backlog** in `worklog.md`: lightweight `## Ideas` section for capturing deferred ideas mid-session — format `- [type] description — optional context`, types: spec/task/step; included in `worklog.template.md`
- **`/add-idea` skill**: capture an idea to the worklog without interrupting the session — infers type from context, asks only when ambiguous; supports Claude Code and Codex
- **Ideas proactive rule** in `process.md`: AI suggests `/add-idea` when an out-of-scope idea surfaces mid-session
- **`/interview` skill**: structured breadth-first interview that walks dimensions, batches independent questions, recommends answers, and captures decisions
- **`/brainstorm` skill**: generate missing angles, better implementations, and new combinations
- **`/thoughts` skill**: lightweight "what are your thoughts?" check-in for quick feedback mid-conversation
- **Spec alignment checks**: `/review-task-plan` verifies plan steps cover spec requirements; `/finish-task` verifies delivery

### Changed
- **`commit.md` is now the single commit codepath** — `finish-task.md`, `step-loop.md`, `do-it.md`, `run-step.md`, `gh-review-fix-loop.md` all delegate to it
- **All prompts read settings from `config.yml`** instead of parsing `project.md` prose
- `finish-task.md` push logic works correctly with per-step commit mode (push happens at task completion even when no uncommitted changes remain)
- Spec template updated with grouped `### Problem` / `### Solution` headings and versioned filename convention
- Task planning rule clarified: steps describe what to build, not behavioral details (those belong in specs)
- **`/start-feature` rewritten**: delegates interview to `/interview`, adds prior-context guard and scope question, mandatory spec+task creation
- **`/run-steps` renamed to `/run-task`** — clearer name, avoids confusion with `/run-step`
- **`/review-plan` renamed to `/review-task-plan`** — disambiguates from verb-verb reading ("review and plan")
- **`review-scope.md` renamed to `detect-review-scope.md`** — verb-noun matches the file's procedural content (internal helper, not a skill)
- **`update-check.md` renamed to `check-update.md`** — disambiguates from verb-verb reading ("update the check"); matches framework convention (`check-task`, `check-update`). Internal helper, not a skill.

### Removed
- **`commit.mode` and `commit.finish_action` config keys** — replaced by `after_step` / `after_task` sections. Silent one-time migration on read.
- **Quality Checks Timing Table** in `process.md` — replaced by a one-line pointer to `config.yml` `after_step` / `after_task`
- **`## Commit Rules:` section** in `task.template.md` — per-task overrides removed; lifecycle config lives in `config.yml` only
- Settings sections from `project.md` and `project.template.md` (moved to `config.yml`)
- `commit+push+pr` finish action (was listed but unsupported since 1.6.0)
- Specs and worklog from git tracking (gitignored — project-specific working files)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Three-layer context model**: specs (requirements) → tasks (plan + progress) → briefs (working knowledge) for persistent AI context across sessions
- **New skills**: `/start-feature`, `/run-task`, `/finish-task`, `/plan-tasks`, `/do-it`, `/align-context`, `/gh-review-fix-loop`
- **Shared step inner loop** (`step-loop.md`): single source of truth for the implement → review → test → commit cycle, referenced by `/run-task` and `/do-it`
- **Spec files** (`.aicontext/specs/`): feature-level requirements, decisions, and non-goals — survive refactors, no file paths or implementation details
- **Brief files** (`.aicontext/data/brief/`): gitignored working memory the AI appends to after each step — enables seamless session restarts via `/check-task`
- **Worklog** (`.aicontext/worklog.md`): spec and task status tracking, replaces `changelog.md`. AI-generated, gitignored.
- **Spec↔task drift detection** in `/check-task`: identifies spec requirements not covered by task steps, offers to add steps or create separate tasks
- **Requirement coverage check**: whenever the AI adds a spec requirement, it immediately verifies task step coverage
- **Configurable commit rules**: project-level defaults in `project.md`, per-task overrides in task files, personal overrides in `local.md`
- **Quality checks table** in `process.md`: configurable matrix of what checks run after steps vs after tasks
- New templates: `spec.template.md`, `brief.template.md`, `worklog.template.md`
- Specs directory (`.aicontext/specs/.gitkeep`) created during `aicontext init`
- Codex skill mirrors for all new skills
- **`/review` skill**: unified review with scope args (diff, branch, commit, path, IDE selection) — replaces `/diff-review` and `/branch-review`
- **`/deep-review` skill**: comprehensive architecture + correctness review with 12-phase methodology (DRY & KISS, Placement, Responsibilities, API Design, Edge Cases, Bugs & Security, Framework Usage, Constants & Naming, Dependencies & Testability, Error Handling, Extensibility)
- **Review criteria prompts**: `review-criteria.md`, `deep-review-criteria.md`, `review-scope.md` — shared between all tools, not just Claude Code
- **Code review template** (`code-review.template.md`): persistent review tracking with refactoring actions, findings, decisions
- **`close-step.md` prompt**: enforces brief/spec updates after each step with visible summary output — prevents agents from skipping context updates
- **`commit_body` option** in Commit Rules: controls whether commits include a body (default: `true` — body with what/why + Co-Authored-By trailer)
- **`/web-inspect` skill**: browser-based investigation using playwright-cli — open pages in headed mode, inspect elements via snapshots, check console errors, capture screenshots. Useful for UI debugging, manual AI testing, and verifying fixes visually
- **`/aic-help` and `/aic-skills` framework meta-skills**: `/aic-help` shows a quickstart guide with workflows and best practices; `/aic-skills` lists all available skills grouped by workflow stage
- **`/create-task` skill**: create a task file from conversation context — lighter alternative to `/start-feature` when a full discovery interview isn't needed
- **`/add-step` skill**: add a new step to the current task from conversation context — plan ahead without implementing
- **Reusable task identification** (`identify-task.md`): shared prompt for finding the active task, prioritizing IDE-opened files

### Changed
- **Renamed `/start-task` → `/start-feature`**: always creates spec + task, no complexity assessment — small work uses direct conversation
- **Renamed "Acceptance Criteria" → "Requirements"** in specs: plain list (no checkboxes), detailed enough for task creation
- **Prompts as single source of truth**: all skill/agent instructions live in `.aicontext/prompts/`, skills are thin wrappers
- `/check-task` now reads three layers (spec → brief → task) with staleness checks
- `/gh-review-fix-loop` cycle reordered: fetch first → triage → fix → test → capture count → commit+push → poll
- Script paths in prompts use `.aicontext/scripts/` (universal) instead of `.claude/scripts/`
- `removeDeprecatedSkills` now cleans both `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/`
- Process rule "stop after step" scoped to manual execution only (not `/run-task`)
- Task template simplified: no acceptance criteria or out-of-scope sections (both live in spec)
- **Merged `deep-reviewer` and `standards-checker` into single `reviewer` agent** — caller specifies criteria prompt, agent is generic
- **Review prompts are self-contained workflows**: setup, scope, criteria, save with template, present — work identically inline or via agent
- **Two review tiers**: `/review` = quick correctness (after step), `/deep-review` = comprehensive (after task)
- Step inner loop simplified from 11 to 9 steps — close-step replaces separate update/brief/elevate steps
- `/run-task` commit logic simplified: only commits per-step, per-task commits handled by `/finish-task` via `finish_action`
- `/finish-task` warns when `finish_action: nothing` but uncommitted changes exist
- **Merged `/code-health` into `/deep-review`**: cross-file checks (duplication, consistency, structural metrics) added as expanded phases — `/deep-review all` replaces `/code-health` for full codebase scans
- **Renamed `/pr-review-check` → `/gh-review-check`** and **`/check-plan` → `/review-plan`** for naming consistency
- Commit messages must describe the staged diff, not session memory
- PR scripts moved from `.claude/scripts/` to `.aicontext/scripts/`; `pr-reviews.js` uses `__dirname` for output path resolution

### Deprecated
- `changelog.md` — replaced by `worklog.md`. Deprecation notice injected during `aicontext update`.
- `/start-task` skill — replaced by `/start-feature`
- `/diff-review` and `/branch-review` — replaced by `/review` with scope args
- `/standards-check` — fully subsumed by `/deep-review`
- `deep-reviewer` and `standards-checker` agents — merged into single `reviewer` agent
- `/code-health` — merged into `/deep-review`
- `/pr-review-check` — renamed to `/gh-review-check`
- `/check-plan` — renamed to `/review-plan`
- `.claude/scripts/` directory — scripts moved to `.aicontext/scripts/`

- Agent delegation rules in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for automatic task routing to subagents
- Agent model configuration step in `generate.md` prompt (auto-detects model and suggests upgrades)
- Agent override protection — existing agent files are never silently overwritten during `init` and `update`

### Changed
- **Renamed `.ai/` folder to `.aicontext/`** - Decided to rename the context folder to better match the project name and make its purpose clearer. Since the project is still in an early stage and not widely used yet, this feels like a good time to make the change.
