# Changelog

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- PR workflow scripts (`pr-reviews`, `pr-resolve`) renamed from `.js` to `.cjs` — fixes "require is not defined" errors in projects with `"type": "module"` in `package.json`
- `aicontext update` now removes old `.js` script files automatically

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Adaptive workflow config** — the AI asks your preferences on first run (reviews, tests, commits, push) and remembers them. All settings live in `config.yml` with personal overrides in `config.local.yml` (gitignored). Interactive setup during `aicontext init`
- **`/draft-issue` creates GitHub issues** — optionally create issues on GitHub directly, save locally, or both. Editable issue template. Auto-fills issue ID for subsequent task creation
- **`/interview` skill** — structured breadth-first interview that recommends answers based on codebase exploration and captures decisions
- **`/brainstorm` skill** — generate missing angles, better implementations, and new combinations
- **`/thoughts` skill** — lightweight "what do you think?" check-in mid-conversation
- **`/add-idea` skill** — capture deferred ideas to a backlog mid-session so they're not lost. AI suggests it when out-of-scope ideas surface
- **`/gh-fix-tests` skill** — automated CI fix: fetches failing checks from GitHub, diagnoses root causes, fixes, pushes, and retries up to 3 times until green
- **Spec alignment checks** — plan and task-close verification that spec requirements are covered
- **Co-Authored-By trailer config** — customizable format, or disable entirely
- **Spec Driven Development** framing — docs and README position AIContext as an SDD framework

### Changed
- **`/start-feature` interview improved** — batches independent questions, recommends answers, walks dimensions breadth-first
- **`/run-steps` renamed to `/run-task`**
- **`/review-plan` renamed to `/review-task-plan`**
- **Quality check prompts use friendly labels** — "Quick review — this step's changes" instead of "Partial"
- **Review scope maps to the right playbook** — quick review for step-level, deep review for task-level
- Unified commit codepath — all prompts delegate to the same commit logic
- Spec requirements now use checkboxes with traceability footers

### Removed
- Old `commit.mode` / `commit.finish_action` config keys (silently migrated)
- Per-task commit rule overrides (lifecycle config lives in `config.yml` only)
- Specs and worklog from git tracking (project-specific working files, now gitignored)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Three-layer context model**: specs (requirements) → tasks (plan + progress) → briefs (working knowledge) for persistent AI context across sessions
- **New skills**: `/start-feature`, `/run-task`, `/finish-task`, `/plan-tasks`, `/do-it`, `/align-context`, `/gh-review-fix-loop`
- **Shared step inner loop** (`step-loop.md`): single source of truth for the implement → review → test → commit cycle, referenced by `/run-task` and `/do-it`
- **Spec files** (`.aicontext/specs/`): feature-level requirements, decisions, and non-goals — survive refactors, no file paths or implementation details
- **Brief files** (`.aicontext/data/brief/`): gitignored working memory the AI appends to after each step — enables seamless session restarts via `/check-task`
- **Worklog** (`.aicontext/worklog.md`): spec and task status tracking, replaces `changelog.md`. AI-generated, gitignored.
- **Spec↔task drift detection** in `/check-task`: identifies spec requirements not covered by task steps, offers to add steps or create separate tasks
- **Requirement coverage check**: whenever the AI adds a spec requirement, it immediately verifies task step coverage
- **Configurable commit rules**: project-level defaults in `project.md`, per-task overrides in task files, personal overrides in `local.md`
- **Quality checks table** in `process.md`: configurable matrix of what checks run after steps vs after tasks
- New templates: `spec.template.md`, `brief.template.md`, `worklog.template.md`
- Specs directory (`.aicontext/specs/.gitkeep`) created during `aicontext init`
- Codex skill mirrors for all new skills
- **`/review` skill**: unified review with scope args (diff, branch, commit, path, IDE selection) — replaces `/diff-review` and `/branch-review`
- **`/deep-review` skill**: comprehensive architecture + correctness review with 12-phase methodology (DRY & KISS, Placement, Responsibilities, API Design, Edge Cases, Bugs & Security, Framework Usage, Constants & Naming, Dependencies & Testability, Error Handling, Extensibility)
- **Review criteria prompts**: `review-criteria.md`, `deep-review-criteria.md`, `review-scope.md` — shared between all tools, not just Claude Code
- **Code review template** (`code-review.template.md`): persistent review tracking with refactoring actions, findings, decisions
- **`close-step.md` prompt**: enforces brief/spec updates after each step with visible summary output — prevents agents from skipping context updates
- **`commit_body` option** in Commit Rules: controls whether commits include a body (default: `true` — body with what/why + Co-Authored-By trailer)
- **`/web-inspect` skill**: browser-based investigation using playwright-cli — open pages in headed mode, inspect elements via snapshots, check console errors, capture screenshots. Useful for UI debugging, manual AI testing, and verifying fixes visually
- **`/aic-help` and `/aic-skills` framework meta-skills**: `/aic-help` shows a quickstart guide with workflows and best practices; `/aic-skills` lists all available skills grouped by workflow stage
- **`/create-task` skill**: create a task file from conversation context — lighter alternative to `/start-feature` when a full discovery interview isn't needed
- **`/add-step` skill**: add a new step to the current task from conversation context — plan ahead without implementing
- **Reusable task identification** (`identify-task.md`): shared prompt for finding the active task, prioritizing IDE-opened files

### Changed
- **Renamed `/start-task` → `/start-feature`**: always creates spec + task, no complexity assessment — small work uses direct conversation
- **Renamed "Acceptance Criteria" → "Requirements"** in specs: plain list (no checkboxes), detailed enough for task creation
- **Prompts as single source of truth**: all skill/agent instructions live in `.aicontext/prompts/`, skills are thin wrappers
- `/check-task` now reads three layers (spec → brief → task) with staleness checks
- `/gh-review-fix-loop` cycle reordered: fetch first → triage → fix → test → capture count → commit+push → poll
- Script paths in prompts use `.aicontext/scripts/` (universal) instead of `.claude/scripts/`
- `removeDeprecatedSkills` now cleans both `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/`
- Process rule "stop after step" scoped to manual execution only (not `/run-task`)
- Task template simplified: no acceptance criteria or out-of-scope sections (both live in spec)
- **Merged `deep-reviewer` and `standards-checker` into single `reviewer` agent** — caller specifies criteria prompt, agent is generic
- **Review prompts are self-contained workflows**: setup, scope, criteria, save with template, present — work identically inline or via agent
- **Two review tiers**: `/review` = quick correctness (after step), `/deep-review` = comprehensive (after task)
- Step inner loop simplified from 11 to 9 steps — close-step replaces separate update/brief/elevate steps
- `/run-task` commit logic simplified: only commits per-step, per-task commits handled by `/finish-task` via `finish_action`
- `/finish-task` warns when `finish_action: nothing` but uncommitted changes exist
- **Merged `/code-health` into `/deep-review`**: cross-file checks (duplication, consistency, structural metrics) added as expanded phases — `/deep-review all` replaces `/code-health` for full codebase scans
- **Renamed `/pr-review-check` → `/gh-review-check`** and **`/check-plan` → `/review-plan`** for naming consistency
- Commit messages must describe the staged diff, not session memory
- PR scripts moved from `.claude/scripts/` to `.aicontext/scripts/`; `pr-reviews.js` uses `__dirname` for output path resolution

### Deprecated
- `changelog.md` — replaced by `worklog.md`. Deprecation notice injected during `aicontext update`.
- `/start-task` skill — replaced by `/start-feature`
- `/diff-review` and `/branch-review` — replaced by `/review` with scope args
- `/standards-check` — fully subsumed by `/deep-review`

- Agent delegation rules in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for automatic task routing to subagents
- Agent model configuration step in `generate.md` prompt (auto-detects model and suggests upgrades)
